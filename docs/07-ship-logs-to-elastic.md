# Ship logs to Elastic

## Intro
Elastic Cloud is observability platform that we will be using to ship the logs generated by the WordPress instance operating within Kubernetes.

## Note
You need to signed up for a trial account that is valid for 14 days. 

## Steps
1. Elastic has very detailed documentation on how to [Install an Elastic Agent in order to collect Kubernetes data](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/fleet/current/install-fleet-managed-elastic-agent.html). Follow the instructions in the link:
    - Pick Kubernetes as a source
    - At the end it will generate a yaml file for the collector [provided here](../wordpress-minikube/elastic-agent-managed-kubernetes.yml)
    - Copy and paste the provided snippet into your terminal and run the below command to activate the collector:
        ```
        kubectl apply -f elastic-agent-managed-kubernetes.yml
        ```
